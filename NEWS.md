# alleleIntegrator major changes

## 0.9.0

 * Added singularity support.  All binary dependencies (except parallel for parallel execution) should automatically be satisfied in a way the user doesn't need to worry about if singularity is installed on the system.
 * Added debug mode to findVariants and alleleCounter.
 * Fixed some bugs here and there.
